<h4>ABOUT NUB AND OUR HISTORY</h4>

<p class="content text-muted mt-3">Keeping in step with the rapidly increasing demand for higher education, the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh passed the Private Universities Act in 1992 which has been revised and replaced by Private University Act 2010. Following the1992 the Act, Bangladesh witnessed a sudden flux of private universities with the promise to provide higher education to students that will be at par with global standards.</p>

<h5 class="know ms-3"> Knowledge for Innovation and Change.</h5>
<p class="content_nub text-muted ms-5 "> -  Northern University Bangladesh.</p>

    <p class="contant text-muted mt-5">
        In 2002, a group of eminent academics recognized this exponential increase in demand and established Northern University Bangladesh on 17 October in order to bring quality education within the reach of students with modest economic means. Sponsored and founded by International Business Agriculture & Technology (IBAT) Trust now known as NUB Trust (NUBT), a registered, non-political, non-profit voluntary organization, NUB made its foray in to the field of higher education and established itself as a center for excellence.
